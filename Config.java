These shapes are rock (a closed fist), paper  (a flat hand), and  scissors (a fist with the index finger and middle finger extended, forming a V). The earliest form of  rock paper scissors -style game originated in China and was subsequently imported into Japan, where it reached its modern standardized form, before being spread throughout the world in the early 20th century.";
